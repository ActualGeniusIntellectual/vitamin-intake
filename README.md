# Daily Vitamin and Mineral Tracker

## About The Project

Welcome to the Daily Vitamin and Mineral Tracker! This project is dedicated to documenting and sharing my personal journey in tracking the intake of vitamins and minerals from various sources, including raw supplements and food. The goal is to maintain transparency and honesty about my nutritional habits, and provide insights that might be beneficial to others interested in nutrition and health.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. **Personal Accountability:** To keep a detailed record of my daily vitamin and mineral intake, ensuring that I am meeting my nutritional needs.
2. **Community Sharing:** To provide a resource for others who are interested in understanding how various foods and supplements contribute to overall nutrition.

## How It Works

This project tracks the intake of vitamins and minerals from two main sources:

- **Raw Supplements:** Documenting the specific supplements taken each day along with their nutritional content.
- **Food Intake:** Recording the different foods consumed daily and their respective vitamin and mineral contributions.
